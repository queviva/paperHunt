    <div class="C">
        In the first hunt, we were dropped in an open
        field.
        <br><br>
        As the prey, I was given a much higher
        top speed than the hunter.
    </div>
    
    <img src="migs/hunt01.png" style="height:auto;">
    
    <div class="Q">
        As you can see, there was simply NO WAY for me
        to catch up. No matter what, Circle could
        ALWAYS outrun me.
        <br><br>
        In fact, it didn't matter how many prey circles
        were in the scene, I could NEVER catch anyone.
    </div>
    
    <img src="migs/hunt02.png" style="height:auto;">
    
    <div class="C">
        That seems kind of obvious: in an open field,
        if the prey's top speed is faster than the
        hunter, no kills will ever be made.
    </div>
        
    </div>

    <div id="hunt1X" class="hunt">
    <div class="Q">
        Things were reversed for the next hunt. This
        time <span class="emp">eYe</span>
        had a much higher top speed than the prey.

    <img src="migs/hunt03.png">
            
    <div class="C">
        I simply couldn't escape!
        <br><br>
        No matter how many
        circles were placed in the scene,
        whichever circle was
        closest to the hunter got caught immediately.
        <br><br>
        Again, this ought to make perfect sense.
    </div>
    
    <div class="Q">
        It might seem like there could NEVER be any
        way to create a fair hunt.
        <br><br>
        But wait...
    </div>
    
    </div>

    <div id="hunt2X" class="hunt">
            
    <div class="C">
        For the third hunt, I was again given a higher
        top speed than the hunting square, but now,
        <span class="emp">obstacles</span>
        were randomly placed throughout the scene.
    </div>
    
    <img src="migs/hunt04.png">
        
    <div class="Q">
        Just like before, I started off unable to catch
        up to any of the prey circles.
        <br><br>
        But then something
        happened...
    </div>
    
    <div class="C">
        I ran into a wall! I had to stop, and turn around
        to get away from the wall.
        <br><br>
        I had no choice but to briefly run TOWARDS the hunter!
    </div>
    
    <div class="Q">
        That was all I needed.
        <br><br>
        When the obstacles forced
        Circle to zig-zag around, it was kind of like
        <i>reducing</i> the prey's top speed.
    </div>
    
    <img src="migs/pursuitVectorChart.png" style="height:auto">
    
    <div class="C">
        When I ran into the wall, I had to stop, and turn around.
        <br><br>
        Sure, <i>technically</i> I was still faster, but I had to
        use some of my speed to run around the walls,
        instead of using all of it to increase my distance
        away from the hunter.
    </div>
    
    <div class="Q">
        And, because I was slower, I trailed behind my
        prey - I didn't even encounter the obstacles
        until AFTER the prey had already run into them.
    </div>
    
    <div class="C">
         A lot of times, I turned around from a wall and
         RIGHT INTO the waiting jaws of the hunting Square.
    </div>
    
    <div class="Q">
        I wasn't WAITING ofcourse - it just appeared that
        way because I was lagging behind due to my slower
        speed.
        <br><br>
        To a lot of people, it <b>appeared</b> as though
        I was intentionally running my prey towards an
        obstacle, and then waiting for the catch,
        <i>on purpose.</i>
        <br><br>
        That's what they call an<br>
        <div style="width:100%;text-align:right" class="emp">
            EMERGENT property!
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="C">
         Of COURSE it's going to look like that ...
    </div>
    
    <div class="L">
        ... and let me tell you why.
    </div>
    
    </div>
    
    <div id="emergency" class="hunt">
    <div class="LL">
        Hi, I'm a <span class="emp">Lab Coat</span>
        <br><br>
        You can tell from my clipboard that I must
        know what I'm talking about.
        <br><br>
        But what <i>am</i> I talking about?
    </div>
    
    <div class="L">
        It was being slower that <i>allowed</i>
        the hunter to catch the prey.
        <br><br>
        <div class="discus">
        By making fewer updates to his direction,
        the hunter appears to be more focused on
        pursuing the prey.  A prey circle
        has the time and speed and quickness of
        opportunity to make many changes to
        its position while the relative lethargy
        of the square only permits the hunter
        to update its postion after the fleeing
        prey has made many twists and turns.
        <br><br>
        <i>If</i> the hunter had the same top
        speed as the prey, he would always be
        right on the heels of the prey, making
        the same number of twists and turns,
        following in the exact footstep of
        the prey, and <i>never catching up.</i>
        <br><br>
        Do you see? Being faster is a disadvantage
        to the hunter - when the hunter's
        top speed is too similar to the prey's top
        speed, there will never be a kill.
        <br><br>
        As we've seen, in open terrain, a faster
        hunter will kill every time, a slower hunter
        will never make a kill - but in the presence
        of obstacles, there's a range of speed
        below which the hunter is, obviously, too
        slow to ever make a kill, but also over
        which the hunter is too fast to take
        advantage of the obstacles.
        <br><br>
        Eventually, ofcourse, there's another
        range of higher speeds where the hunter
        is fast enough to outrun the prey;
        but what's fascinating is that there happens
        to be a range of lower speeds at which
        hunting is much more efficient.

            Let's see what other possible ways
            could allow a slower hunter to catch
            a faster prey.

    <div id="trianglePursuit" class="hunt">
        <div class="Q">
            Again, we were placed in an open
            terrain, but this time there were
            several squares - a small pack of
            us, if you will.
        </div>
        <div class="C">
            I was given a higher top speed, and
            things were looking good at first.
        </div>
        <div class="Q">
            As members of a pack, we ofcourse
            stayed a certain distance away from
            eachother as we chased down Circle.
            Initially, we all had identical top
            speeds as the prey, and were never
            able to catch up in the open terrain.
        </div>
        <div class="C">
            We formed a small triangle, but since
            the pack members pursued me at the
            same rate that I fled, at each step
            of the way, our little triangle remained
            the same.
            <br><br>
            You can see in this pursuit diagram that
            <i>nothing changed</i> between steps,
            and a kill was never made.
        </div>
        <img src="migs/equalTriangle.png">
        <div class="C">
            Looking good for me so far.
        </div>
        <div class="Q">
            Next, in the same open terrain, one of
            the square hunters was given a
            LOWER top speed.
        </div>
        <div class="C">
            That sounds good too!
            <br><br>
            Or is it - slower hunters didn't always
            help me out before, did they?
        </div>
        <div class="Q">
            In this updated pursuit diagram you can
            see that we initially formed an
            equilateral triangle, but as the slower
            hunting square lagged behind, our
            arrangement became more scalene, forcing
            us into a curved path.
        </div>
        <img src="migs/slowTriangle.png">
        <div class="C">
            You see, as a fleeing prey, my goal is
            to get as far as I can from ALL pursuing
            hunters. When the squares are equally
            far away, my safest flight path is,
            ofcourse, straight ahead.
            <br><br>
            But as one of the pursuing squares lags
            behind, it's safer for me to turn slightly
            towards the side of the slower hunter.

            What Circle didn't know was that there

        <div class="C">

            <br><br>
            In this pursuit diagram, the cripplingly
            slow hunter is shown in red; each of
            his steps is much smaller than our own.

            Oh no.

        <div class="Q">
            You can see what happened: as we looped
            around, we drove the prey circle straight
            towards the waiting jaws of the slowest
            square.
        </div>
        <div class="C">
            That's ridiculous!
        </div>
        <div class="L">
            No, that's <i>math</i>-liculous.
            <br><br>
            Let me explain.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="ambushless" class="hunt">
        <div class="LL">
            There is no ambush, there is no planning,
            there is no communication between members
            of the pack.
            <br><br>
            <div class="discus">
            All they do is, individually, try to get
            as close to the prey as they can while
            the prey tries to get safely away from
            them.
            <br><br>
            As a result, this <i>appears</i> as though
            some members of the pack are intentionally
            driving the prey toward other members who
            are lying in wait.
            <br><br>
            Running this same scenario in a scene with
            obstacles produces even more striking
            behaviors. The slower hunters appear to
            be <i>hiding out</i> in the obstacles
            waiting to ambush the prey; which, again,
            is not happening; their slower rate of
            updating their position causes them to
            take longer to negotiate their way around
            obstacles, during which time the prey is
            being driven towards them.
            <br><br>
            Once more, the most interesting thing we've
            noticed is that it's not just possible
            for slower hunters to catch faster prey,
            but it's often <i>advantageous</i>
            to be considerably slower than the prey.
            <br><br>
            Infact, in the previous scenario,
            it's often the slowest member of the
            pack who makes the kill.
            <br><br>
            Other people disagree, saying that the
            most interesting thing we've noticed
            so far is that pack hunting
            emerges on its own; it doesn't even
            require communication between pack members!

    <div id="poinson" class="hunt">
        <div class="C">
            In the next series of hunts, I was
            turned into a deadly, deadly, poison.
        </div>
        <div class="Q">
            What he means is that there were several
            prey members in a herd and one of them
            was marked with an INFECTION.
        </div>
        <div class="C">
            For the first few hunts, the infection
        had NO AFFECT on the prey.
            <br><br>
            That is to say, everyone's top speeds
            remained the same.
        </div>
        <div class="Q">
            As before, in an open field, when the
            prey has a higher top speed than the
            hunter, there is never a kill.
            <br><br>
            And when the hunter has a higher top
            speed, he gets a kill every time.
            During infected hunts where the infection
            has NO INFLUENCE over the prey, the
            hunter simply catches the closest
            prey first, and therefore makes exactly
            the same percent of infected kills as
            there are infected prey.
        </div>
        <div class="C">
            That ought to make a lot of sense,
            it's identical to the first series of
            hunts.
            <br><br>
            Next, the hunter was given a slower
            top speed than the prey, BUT now the
            infection gradually caused the afflicted
            member of the herd to have a slower and
            slower top speed.
        </div>
        <div class="Q">
            The obvious thing happened: during the
            time that all the herd members had higher
            top speeds than the hunter, there were
            no kills, but the instant the infected
            prey slowed enough to be caught, he was.
            <br><br>
            The hunter made a kill 100% of the time,
            and 100% of the kills were infected;
            the infection got transmitted EVERY
            time.

            <div class="discus">
                A lot of this is <i>tautological</i>,
                if you know what I mean.
                <br><br>
                Slower hunters CAN'T catch faster
                prey in an open run - that's what
                "faster" means in this context.
                <br><br>
                Faster hunters ALWAYS catch their
                prey. In the construct of this
                environment, that's basically what
                these terms just mean.
                <br><br>
                So, it ought to be self-edivent
                that when infections cause faster
                prey to slow down, EVERY kill
                will be of an infected herd member.

        <div class="Q">
            What happened when we sent an entire pack
            after an entire herd when there were
            infected prey?
            <br><br>
            Hunters had slower top speeds than the
            prey - but does that mean the pack will
            only kill the slowest, weakest, sickest
            member of the herd?
        </div>
        <div class="C">
            That's not what happened last time!
            <br><br>
            If you remember, my having a higher top
            speed did NOT MATTER against a pack.
            <br><br>
            I was chased, and routed, and ambushed,
            and run into a trap, regardless of my
            speed.
        </div>
        <div class="Q">
            And that's what happened again.
            <br><br>
            The top speed of the prey member had
            NO BEARING on which one of them we
            caught.
        </div>
        <div class="C">
            Do you see what happened there?
            <br><br>
            The pack did NOT isolate and kill
            off the weak; the pack ate whatever
            member of my herd they happened
            to be able to ambush.
            <br><br>
            The fact that I was POISONOUS still
            didn't help me defeat a pack of hunters!

            And it never will, let me babble on

            Against a herd, a lone-predator will
            always kill the slower, weaker members.
            In the case that this slowness or
            weakness is caused by a transmissable
            infection, the lone-predator will
            be exposed to that disease at a much
            much higher rate than a pack.
            <br><br>
            A slower pack - which as was demonstrated
            here, has no coordinated hunting tactics,
            no communication, and no leadership -
            catches prey entirely independent from
            the prey's health.
            <br><br>
            A pack is capable of catching prey that
            is FASTER than itself. A pack's slowest
            members are often at an ADVANTAGE during
            a kill. The slower members of the pack
            are integral to the apparent "techniques"
            of pack hunting.
            <br><br>
            But what other apparent behaviors do
            people notice from these pack hunts?
            <br><br>
            If, besides assigning infection to
            weaken herd members, we assign "age"
            to cause weakness among pack members,
            immediately we notice that the younger
            members of the pack give priority
            to the elder members.  The younger
            faster members of the pack drive the
            delicious prey TO the elderly ones.
            The elderly members eat first, and have
            the least physically demanding role
            in a hunt.
            <br><br>
            What other "altriustic" delusions
            might people notice?
            <br><br>
            Remember that
            as an infected herd member slows down,
            it can be caught by a, now, faster
            hunter - and that it was <i>from</i>
            being slower that the pack was able to
            ambush its prey.
            
            <br><br>
            That is to say, the younger, faster,
            healthier members of the pack end up
            <i>catching</i> infected herd members
            themselves, but driving healthy prey
            <i>towards</i> the waiting elderly pack
            hunters; it appears as though the young
            are offering the <i>better food</i>
            to the elderly.
        </div>
        </div>
        <div class="L">
            Enough of that. Let's look at some
