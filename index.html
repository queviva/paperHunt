            In the first hunt, we were dropped in an open
            field.
            <br><br>
            As the prey, I was given a much higher
            top speed than the hunter.
        </div>
        
        <img src="migs/hunt01.png" style="height:auto;">
        
        <div class="Q">
            As you can see, there was simply NO WAY for me
            to catch up. No matter what, Circle could
            ALWAYS outrun me.
            <br><br>
            In fact, it didn't matter how many prey circles
            were in the scene, I could NEVER catch anyone.
        </div>
        
        <img src="migs/hunt02.png" style="height:auto;">
        
        <div class="C">
            That seems kind of obvious: in an open field,
            if the prey's top speed is faster than the
            hunter, no kills will ever be made.
        </div>
            
    </div>

    <div id="hunt1X" class="hunt">
        
        <div class="Q">
            Things were reversed for the next hunt. This
            time <span class="emp">eYe</span>
            had a much higher top speed than the prey.
        </div>

        <div class="C">
            I simply couldn't escape!
            <br><br>
            No matter how many
            circles were placed in the scene,
            whichever circle was
            closest to the hunter got caught immediately.
            <br><br>
            Again, this ought to make perfect sense.
        </div>
        
        <div class="Q">
            It might seem like there could NEVER be any
            way to create a fair hunt.
            <br><br>
            But wait...

        <div class="C">
            For the third hunt, I was again given a higher
            top speed than the hunting square, but now,
            <span class="emp">obstacles</span>
            were randomly placed throughout the scene.
        </div>
        
        <img src="migs/hunt04.png">
            
        <div class="Q">
            Just like before, I started off unable to catch
            up to any of the prey circles.
            <br><br>
            But then something
            happened...
        </div>
        
        <div class="C">
            I ran into a wall! I had to stop, and
            turn around to get away from the wall.
            <br><br>
            I had no choice but to briefly run
            TOWARDS the hunter!
        </div>
        
        <div class="Q">
            That was all I needed.
            <br><br>
            When the obstacles forced
            Circle to zig-zag around, it was kind of like
            <i>reducing</i> the prey's top speed.
        </div>
        
        <img src="migs/pursuitVectorChart.png" style="height:auto">
        
        <div class="C">
            When I ran into the wall, I had to stop,
            and turn around.
            <br><br>
            Sure, <i>technically</i> I was still faster,
            but I had to use some of my speed to
            run around the walls, instead of using
            all of it to increase my distance
            away from the hunter.
        </div>
        
        <div class="Q">
            And, because I was slower, I trailed behind my
            prey - I didn't even encounter the obstacles
            until AFTER the prey had already run into them.
        </div>
        
        <div class="C">
             A lot of times, I turned around from
             a wall and RIGHT INTO the waiting jaws
             of the hunting Square.
        </div>
        
        <div class="Q">
            I wasn't WAITING ofcourse - it just
            appeared that way because I was lagging
            behind due to my slower speed.
            <br><br>
            To a lot of people, it <b>appeared</b>
            as though I was intentionally running
            my prey towards an obstacle, and then
            waiting for the catch, <i>on purpose.</i>

            Hi, I'm a <span class="emp">Lab Coat</span>
            <br><br>
            You can tell from my clipboard that I must
            know what I'm talking about.
            <br><br>
            But what <i>am</i> I talking about?
        </div>
        
        <div class="L">
            It was being slower that <i>allowed</i>
            the hunter to catch the prey.
            <br><br>
            <div class="discus">
            By making fewer updates to his direction,
            the hunter appears to be more focused on
            pursuing the prey.  A prey circle
            has the time and speed and quickness of
            opportunity to make many changes to
            its position while the relative lethargy
            of the square only permits the hunter
            to update its postion <i>after</i> the
            fleeing prey has made many twists and turns.
            <br><br>
            <i>If</i> the hunter had the same top
            speed as the prey, he would always be
            right on the heels of the prey, making
            the same number of twists and turns,
            following in the exact footsteps of
            the prey, and <i>never catching up.</i>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <img src="migs/tooFast.svg" style="filter:none;">
       
        <div class="L">
            Being faster is a disadvantage to the hunter.
            <br><br>
            <div class="discus">
            It's as though the prey's flight path is
            giving the hunter instructions on how to
            smooth-out a more efficient navigation
            around the obstacles.
            <br><br>
            When the hunter's
            top speed is too similar to the prey's top
            speed, there will never be a kill.
            <br><br>
            As we've seen, in open terrain, a faster
            hunter will kill every time, a slower hunter
            will never make a kill - but in the presence
            of obstacles, there's a range of speed
            below which the hunter is, obviously, too
            slow to ever make a kill, but also over
            which the hunter is too fast to take
            advantage of the obstacles.
            <br><br>
            Eventually, ofcourse, there's another
            range of higher speeds where the hunter
            is fast enough to outrun the prey;
            but what's fascinating is that there happens
            to be a range of lower speeds at which
            hunting is much more efficient.

            Again, we were placed in an open

            As members of a pack, we ofcourse
            stayed a certain distance away from
            eachother as we chased down Circle.
            Initially, we all had identical top
            speeds as the prey, and were never
            able to catch up in the open terrain.

            We formed a small triangle.

            at the same rate that I fled,
            our little triangle remained the same
            at each step of the way.

            You can see in this pursuit diagram that
            <i>nothing changed</i> between steps,

            In this pursuit diagram, the cripplingly

            You can see what happened: as we looped
            around, we drove the prey circle straight
            towards the waiting jaws of the slowest
            square.
        </div>
        <div class="C">
            That's ridiculous!

            No, that's <i>math</i>-liculous.
            <br><br>
            Let me explain.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="ambushless" class="hunt">
        <div class="LL">
            There is no ambush, there is no planning,
            there is no communication between members
            of the pack.
            <br><br>
            <div class="discus">
            All they do is, individually, try to get
            as close to the prey as they can while
            the prey tries to get safely away from
            them.
            <br><br>
            As a result, this <i>appears</i> as though
            some members of the pack are intentionally
            driving the prey toward other members who
            are lying in wait.
            <br><br>
            Running this same scenario in a scene with
            obstacles produces even more striking
            behaviors. The slower hunters appear to
            be <i>hiding out</i> in the obstacles
            waiting to ambush the prey; which, again,
            is not happening; their slower rate of
            updating their position causes them to
            take longer to negotiate their way around
            obstacles, during which time the prey is
            being driven towards them.
            <br><br>
            Once more, the most interesting thing we've
            noticed is that it's not just possible
            for slower hunters to catch faster prey,
            but it's often <i>advantageous</i>
            to be considerably slower than the prey.
            <br><br>
            Infact, in the previous scenario,
            it's often the slowest member of the
            pack who makes the kill.
            <br><br>
            Other people disagree, saying that the
            most interesting thing we've noticed
            so far is that pack hunting
            emerges on its own; it doesn't even
            require communication between pack members!

        <div class="C">
            In the next series of hunts, I was
            turned into a deadly, deadly, poison.

        <div class="Q">
            What he means is that there were several
            prey members in a herd and one of them
            was marked with an INFECTION.
        </div>
        <div class="C">
            For the first few hunts, the infection
        had NO AFFECT on the prey.
            <br><br>
            That is to say, everyone's top speeds
            remained the same.
        </div>
        <div class="Q">
            As before, in an open field, when the
            prey has a higher top speed than the
            hunter, there is never a kill.
            <br><br>
            And when the hunter has a higher top
            speed, he gets a kill every time.
            During infected hunts where the infection
            has NO INFLUENCE over the prey, the
            hunter simply catches the closest
            prey first, and therefore makes exactly
            the same percent of infected kills as
            there are infected prey.
        </div>
        <div class="C">
            That ought to make a lot of sense,
            it's identical to the first series of
            hunts.
            <br><br>
            Next, the hunter was given a slower
            top speed than the prey, BUT now the
            infection gradually caused the afflicted
            member of the herd to have a lower and
            lower top speed.
        </div>
        <div class="Q">
            The obvious thing happened: during the
            time that all the herd members had higher
            top speeds than the hunter, there were
            no kills, but the instant the infected
            prey slowed enough to be caught, he was.
            <br><br>
            The hunter made a kill 100% of the time,
            and 100% of the kills were infected;
            the infection got transmitted EVERY
            time.

                Slower hunters CAN'T catch faster
                prey in an open run - that's what
                "faster" means in this context.
                <br><br>
                Faster hunters ALWAYS catch their
                prey. In the construct of this

                these terms just mean.
                <br><br>
                So, it ought to be self-edivent
                that when infections cause faster
                prey to slow down, EVERY kill
                will be of an infected herd member.

            Hunters had lower top speeds than the
            prey - but does that mean the pack will
            only kill the slowest, weakest, sickest

            Against a herd, a lone-predator will
            always kill the slower, weaker members.
            In the case that this slowness or
            weakness is caused by a transmissable
            infection, the lone-predator will
            be exposed to that disease at a much
            much higher rate than a pack.
            <br><br>
            A slower pack - which as was demonstrated
            here, has no coordinated hunting tactics,
            no communication, and no leadership -
            catches prey entirely INDEPENDENT from
            the prey's health.
            <br><br>
            A pack is capable of catching prey that
            is FASTER than itself. A pack's slowest
            members are often at an ADVANTAGE during
            a kill. The slower members of the pack
            are integral to the apparent "techniques"
            of pack hunting.
            <br><br>
            But what other apparent behaviors do
            people notice from these pack hunts?
            <br><br>
            If, besides assigning infection to
            weaken herd members, we assign "age"
            to cause weakness among pack members,
            immediately we notice that the younger
            members of the pack give priority
            to the elder members.  The younger
            faster members of the pack drive the
            delicious prey TO the elderly ones.
            The elderly members eat first, and have
            the least physically demanding role
            in a hunt.
            <br><br>
            What other "altriustic" delusions
            might people notice?
            <br><br>
            Remember that
            as an infected herd member slows down,
            it can be caught by a, now, faster
            hunter - and that it was <i>from</i>
            being slower that the pack was able to
            ambush its prey.
            
            <br><br>
            That is to say, the younger, faster,
            healthier members of the pack end up
            <i>catching</i> infected herd members
            themselves, but driving healthy prey
            <i>towards</i> the waiting elderly pack
            hunters; it appears as though the young
            are offering the <i>better food</i>
            to the elderly.

            There were, relative to the top speed of

            hunters: FAST, MEDIUM, and SLOW.
            <br><br>
            Fast hunters have top speeds higher
            than the top speed of the prey.

            Slow hunters have top speeds slower
            even than the infected prey.

            And, Medium-speed hunters are slower

                <li><b>Medium</b> hunters initially
                did not catch anything, but when
                the infected prey slowed down enough,
                <i>every one</i> of the medium speed
                hunters became infected.

            Once again, it's the slowing down that allows

            What Laptop has been trying to
            avoid is that the PREY emerges too.
            <br><br>
            <div class="discus">
            In a scene with a large number of
            hunters that have varying top speeds,
            a large number of prey that ALSO
            have varying top speeds, and a
            lethargy-infection, what will happen?
            <br><br>
            We've shown that the transmission of
            infection will cause the distribution
            of 'fast' and 'slow' and 'medium'
            hunters to emerge in the ratio that
            promotes the best pack hunting.
            But, remember that 'fast' and 'slow'
            were <i>relative</i> to the prey's
            top speed.
            <br><br>
            So, in our hunt where everyone - both
            hunters and prey - have random top
            speeds, the 'packs' that will form
            will be relative to the group of prey
            for which that pack has the
            speed-composition to match.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="L">
            <div class="discus">
            You see? In all of the previous hunts,
            we've intentionally set the top speed
            of the prey in order to demonstrate
            something.
            <br><br>
            But when random top speeds are set for
            each circle, WHATEVER group of prey
            objects happens to have the range of
            speeds for which the emerging pack's
            speed-composition makes those circles
            the best prey will BECOME that pack's prey.
            <br><br>
            The HERD emerges - similar prey
            <i>form a group</i> that is best hunted
            by the pack.
            <br><br>
            In an <i>enormous</i> scene where hunters
            and prey all have random top speeds,
            you will think that what you're seeing
            is <i>multiple packs</i> forming, and
            <i>multiple herds</i> forming;
            packs will form that have the RELATIVE
            SPEED DISTRIBUTIONS for specific groups
            of prey objects, and you will think the
            prey objects are forming herds.
            <br><br>
            You will think you're seeing
            SPECIES of hunters and species of prey,
            in that you will notice particular
            groups of squares exhibiting what you
            call cooperative hunting behaviors
            with eachother, but not with other
            squares.
            <br><br>
            You will notice particular groups of
            prey associating with eachother and
            being hunted by certain groups of
            squares while NOT being hunted by
            other square-packs.
            <br><br>
            But there is no communication between
            ANY of the objects - either the
            hunters or the prey.
            <br><br>
            All of these things would emerge
            when run with enough computing power

        <div class="discus" style="font-size:0.6em;">
        Appendectomy: The algorithm used for the
        pack hunting scenes is the same for all
        objects in the scene, and has been briefly
        described - at the moment, the license
        for the actual program used to run the
        simulated hunts does not permit that code
        to be included here.
        <br><br>
        Every object in the scene perceives a
        Danger Bubble around every other object
        in the scene.
        <br><br>
        Every object has an interval at which it
        performs the Danger Bubble calculation,
        which is:
        <br>
        <ul style="list-style:square;font-style:italic;">
            <li>
                compute an escape vector out of every
                object's Danger Bubble
            </li>
            <li>
                move at your top speed along the
                sum of those vectors
            </li>
        </ul>
        That's all they do.
        <br><br>
        Objects perceive bubbles of differring
        size around different objects;
        objects have different top speeds and
        different levels of health; they re-run
        their danger-bubble calculation at different
        rates.
        <br><br>
        Their health is a <b>coefficient</b>
        by which all other values get
        multiplied - that is to say,
        your top speed never actually changes;
        it's the value of <code><i>health*speed</i></code>
        that changes; the size of the danger zone
        around other objects never varies, it's
        <code><i>health*radius</i></code> that varies;
        you update your bubble calculation every
        <code><i>health*interval</i></code> milliseconds;
        you see?
        <br><br>
        Again, these intrinsic values never change
        for the individual object - they might,
        however, differ in that object's <i>offspring</i>,
        but for that object's entire existence, the
        values remain the same; only the health
        coefficient changes.
        <br><br>
        None of the hunts run for these experiments
        used offspring - the computational power
        required is already outrageous; and why?
        <br><br>
        It should be fairly obvious that, while this
        algorithm is incredibly simple, it grows
        at O(n2) and worse, it <i>has to</i>.
        It runs in real-time, and cannot be
        pre-computed. Even the kind of management
        that would permit larger sized scenes is
        more than I will allow Lapcoat to access.
        <br><br>
        The computation for the escape vector is
        basically nothing - since every danger bubble
        is a perfect circle centered on the object,
        the 'most efficient' escape is literally
        just the <i>opposite direction</i> from
        the object - that is,
        <code><i>pi+atan2(dy,dx)</i></code>;
        the magnitude of that vector is just
        how far you are from the bubble's circumfrence:
        <code><i>radius-distance</i></code>
